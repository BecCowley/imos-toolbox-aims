% a boolean to bound the threshold detection by depth. Turn this on to limit bad markings to bins further away from a specific depth (inclusive). For upward (downward) looking adcps, the Bins deeper (shallower) than a certain depth bound value will always be good.
bound_by_depth = 0
% a boolean to bound the threshold detection by index. Turn this on limit bad markings to bins further away from a bin index (inclusive). Bins with index value between 1:bound_value will always be good.
bound_by_index = 0
%bound value is positive in meters (bound_by_depth) or in bin index (bound_by_index).
bound_value = 99999
% propagate will expand the markings for bins further away. So if bin N from Nbins was marked, N:Nbin will be marked as bad.
propagate = 0
